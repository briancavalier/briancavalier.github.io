<p>Last week, I whipped up a very simple <a href="http://briancavalier.posterous.com/simple-custom-scrolling" title="Simple custom scrolling">example of a custom scrolling mechanism</a> in Javascript.  I've updated it to handle both horizontal and vertical scrolling, and cleaned up the code a bit more.  <a href="http://bit.ly/9A3JAi" title="Custom scrolling example">Check it out</a> and feel free to reuse the ideas, or the code, or to leave suggestions on how it can be improved.  Enjoy!</p>
<p>Oh, and have you heard that I'm working on a name for my company?  <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGZ2MEFFU1dsbnVZRmIyNXBEQmRDX0E6MQ" title="Help me name my company">You can help</a>.</p>
