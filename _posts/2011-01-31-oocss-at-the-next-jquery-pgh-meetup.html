<p>I&rsquo;ll be speaking about OOCSS at the next <a href="https://twitter.com/jquerypgh">jQuery Pittsburgh</a> meetup, this Thursday (2/3) at 6:30pm at <a href="http://www.hackpittsburgh.org" title="Hack Pittsburgh">HackPittsburgh</a>.  I&rsquo;m planning to present some similar material as John Hann and I presented at jQCon in September, but I&rsquo;ll also be including an expanded section on how to get started with OOCSS, as well as a section on OOCSS antipatterns.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/b4nn0n">Chris Bannon</a> from <a href="http://wijmo.com/" title="Wijmo - jQuery UI Widgets">Wijmo</a> for organizing the meetup, and for inviting me to speak.  Hope to see you there!</p>
