title: Dojo Widgets Quick Start
published: true

<p>I used <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org" title="dojo">dojo</a> from the days of 0.4 up through 1.1 on a large and complex project, and it was great.  I hadn&rsquo;t touched it in about a year or so, until a couple weeks ago.  Now, I have two client projects where I&rsquo;m using dojo 1.4, and I&rsquo;ve needed to do some prototyping, so I figured I&rsquo;d see how quickly I could get a few things up and running using a few <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/index.html" title="dijit">dojo widgets</a> out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>I was quickly reminded of a few of the gotchas you&rsquo;ll encounter when trying to get started with dojo widgets, so I figured I&rsquo;d write up a simple quickstart guide, in hopes of saving someone else a few minutes (or hours) of frustration.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a gist with the little things you need to do to get started with declarative style widgets.</p>
<p>Hope that helps you get started using dojo widgets.  So far, using dojo widgets for rapid prototyping has been a win, although it has still require writing some custom code (including custom widgets).  I&rsquo;ll report more on the experience soon.</p>
