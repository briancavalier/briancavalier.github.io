<p>My dad and I stopped by Dirty Harry's in Verona today because I <br />noticed they had a Trek belt-drive bike in the window a few weeks ago, <br />and I wanted to try it out. Unfortunately, it was already sold and <br />gone. So we just looked around for a bit, and noticed they had some <br />really cool cruisers. <p /> Oh, and an $8k Specialized S-Works. Ridiculous. Awesome, but <br />ridiculous. I think I like the cruisers better, anyway.</p>
