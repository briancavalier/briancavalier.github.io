<p>The bike is ready to go after a full tear down, cleaning, and rebuild. &nbsp;When I was taking the cassette off, my rear hub axle nut came off and the hub came open, so I decided to dive in a rebuild both hubs, too. &nbsp;The Campy hubs are designed to be user-serviceable, so it didn't really long at all. &nbsp;I took the bike out for a quick spin tonight, and no more creaking bottom bracket! &nbsp;Whew ... must have been moisture from when I got caught in the rain a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;A good cleaning and re-greasing is all it needed, I suppose.</p>
