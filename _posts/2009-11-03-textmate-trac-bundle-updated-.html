<p>I just released version 1.2 of my&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/textmate-trac-bundle/">Textmate Trac bundle</a>. &nbsp;It includes an awesome new Preview command contributed by&nbsp;Tudor Marghidanu. &nbsp;While editing a Trac wiki page, just hit <code>command-option-control-p</code> (same as Markdown, etc.) to pop up an HTML formatted preview of the page. &nbsp;Seriously useful. &nbsp;Thanks Tudor!</p>
<p />
<div>The command requires the Text::Trac perl module, which you can install from CPAN by running the following in Terminal:</div>
<p />
<div><code>sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::Trac'</code></div>
<p />
<div>If this is the first time you've used CPAN, it will probably ask you a few questions, and accepting the defaults usually works out well.</div>
<p />
<div>Enjoy.</div>
