title: Help me name my company

<p>Recently, I decided to start my own company to do Software Architecture and User Experience Engineering.  The company needs a name, and you can help!  Here are a few of the names I am considering.  You may know what some of them mean, others you may not.  That's ok.  I am interested in hearing your opinion on whether you like one of them better than the others, for whatever reasons you choose.</p>
<p>I won't be offended if you don't like any of them.  That's useful information, too.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.  If there is a clear favorite, I will announce results on <a href="http://briancavalier.com" title="briancavalier.com" target="_blank">briancavalier.com</a><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><br /></span></p>
