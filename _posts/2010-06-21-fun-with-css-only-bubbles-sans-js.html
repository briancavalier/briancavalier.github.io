<p>I just couldn't help but try to figure out a way to do <a href="http://post.ly/kFGR" title="Fun with CSS-only bubbles">those hover tooltip bubbles</a> without Javascript, so I came up with a way.  This is one is pure CSS3 transforms and transitions, triggered by a selected nested within a hover, which is a bit of a strange construct, but works, at least in Safari 5 (haven't tested other browsers yet).  It does have some caveats in its current form, but <a href="http://bit.ly/9WvbAe" title="Fun with CSS-only bubbles, sans JS">give it a try</a>.</p>
