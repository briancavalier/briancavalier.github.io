<p>Recently, I needed to create a simple, animated tooltip.  Since I've been playing with CSS3 here and there, I decided to see if I could create one that is entirely CSS-based, including animated in/out transitions.  I almost made it.  Unfortunately, there's no way I know of using pure WebKit CSS3 transitions to make one element trigger an animation on another element, so I had to resort to some simple Javascript to trigger the hover animation on the top paragraph.  All the other animations are CSS3-only.</p>
<p>Take a <a href="http://bit.ly/dprG9s" title="Fun with CSS-only bubbles">peek</a>, and feel free to use any of the code, or the idea.</p>
