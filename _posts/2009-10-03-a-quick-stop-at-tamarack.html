<p>We stopped for a bit at <a href="http://www.tamarackwv.com/" title="Tamarack">Tamarack</a>, in Beckley, WV with my parents for lunch. &nbsp;They have tons of incredible, and silly, local crafts, and it's fun just to walk through and look.</p>
<p>That last photo is obviously not from Tamarack. &nbsp;It's the new dresser we bought in Charleston, but I accidentally added to this gallery, and apparently there isn't a way to remove a photo from a gallery in Posterous yet! &nbsp;D'oh!</p>
