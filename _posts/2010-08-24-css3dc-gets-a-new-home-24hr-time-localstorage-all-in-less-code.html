<p>I decided to give the CSS3 digital clock <a href="http://briancavalier.com/digital-clock/" title="CSS3 Digital Clock">a new home</a>, and in the process, couldn't help but hack on it a bit more. &nbsp;It has a setting for 12 or 24 hour time, and uses <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/" title="Web Storage at W3C">localStorage</a> to remember both your 12/24 and color settings, so you can keep the time you want, in the color you want, whenever you want. &nbsp;Despite all of that, the HTML, CSS, and JS are a bit lighter and more streamlined now as well.</p>
<p>Oh, and it looks great as an OS X dashboard widget. &nbsp;You can use Safari's web clip feature to snag it and put it on your dashboard!</p>
