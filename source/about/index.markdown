I'm just your average 30-something, web software-writing, dog-loving, bike-riding Orthodox Christian, baritone, family guy.  I'm a Web front-end guy at [Pivotal](http://gopivotal.com), co-founder of [cujoJS](http://cujojs.com), and founder of [Hovercraft Studios](http://hovercraftstudios.com), a Web UX consultancy in Pittsburgh.
