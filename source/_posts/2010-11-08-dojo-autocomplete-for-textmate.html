title: Dojo Autocomplete for TextMate
published: true
---
<p>One of the biggest complaints I hear about&nbsp;<a href="http://macromates.com" title="Macromates, makers of TextMate">TextMate</a>&nbsp;is that it doesn't have some sort of native intellisense, and doesn't do code completion. &nbsp;Those are typically features provided by "bigger" IDEs. &nbsp;TextMate started life as a text editor, and has had different goals than other IDEs, so even though TextMate has grown closer to full-blown IDE over the past few years (thanks to lots of great community bundle contributions), it's not really hard to understand why it hasn't provide those features natively.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that TextMate provides some builtin help for rolling your own completions, and a lot of folks have done that for various languages and platforms. &nbsp;I decided to take a crack at it for&nbsp;<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" title="Dojo toolkit">Dojo</a>&nbsp;as a part of a new, simplified Dojo bundle I've been working on. &nbsp;Here are a couple teaser screenshots of what I have so far.</p>
<p>I'm not ready to post the bundle yet, but I'm actively working on it, so I hope to have an initial version ready within the next couple of weeks.</p>
