title: CSS3 Digital Clock

<p>You know how the saying goes, something like "when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail".  Lately, as you may have guessed from some <a href="http://briancavalier.posterous.com/css-layers-and-glassgradient-buttons">recent</a> <a href="http://briancavalier.posterous.com/fun-with-css-only-bubbles-sans-js">posts</a>, my favorite hammer has been HTML5 plus CSS3.  Recently I've been looking for a good alarm clock app for my iPhone, and seeing some of the gorgeous digital clock apps got me wondering if I could create one using CSS3.</p>
<p>After a couple hours hacking last night, I think I ended up with something that looks pretty good.  There are generous helpings of CSS3 gradients, <code>rgba</code>, and <code>opacity</code>, a side of CSS transitions, and a sprinkling of <code>skew</code> and <code>scale</code> transforms.  There's a side of dojo to pull it all together.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://bit.ly/bZ9MSz" title="CSS3 Digital Clock">go keep some time</a>, and pick your favorite color.  Oh, and let it sit for a bit ... you never know what might happen.</p>
