title: A week with the Magic Mouse
published: true

<div>Recently, Pasha chomped my Revolution MX. &nbsp;Of course, the one thing she damaged was the mouse's best feature, the free-spin scroll wheel. &nbsp;So, I decided to try a <a href="http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/">Magic Mouse</a> as a replacement. &nbsp;Here are a few impressions after a week.</div>
<div>The good:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The tracking seems very accurate, and the pointer motion is the smoothest I've seen in a bluetooth mouse. &nbsp;The mouse glides easily on most relatively smooth surfaces.</li>
<li>Vertical and horizontal scrolling, with momentum&nbsp;is nothing short of <em>pure awesome</em>.</li>
<li>The click has a crisp, intentional feel, and right-clicking works well (I never had a problem with right-clicking on the Mighty Mouse either, so YMMV!)</li>
<li>No dongle! &nbsp;And it seems to reconnect instantly even after sitting unused for hours</li>
<li>I love the simple preference pane with the embedded movie showing how to use the mouse. &nbsp;Of course, one could argue that if a mouse requires that you watch a movie to know how to use it, it's too hard to use.</li>
</ul>
The bad:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The profile is just too low. &nbsp;Maybe I'm still missing the Revo MX, but there's really no way for me to rest my palm on the Magic Mouse. &nbsp;Consequently, I have noticed a bit more hand fatigue.</li>
<li>The two-finger left-right swipe gestures are hard. &nbsp;I don't think human anatomy was meant to do these while grasping something! &nbsp;I have to release the mouse entirely with my ring and pinky fingers to make these gestures reliably. &nbsp;I really like the idea, and the effect, but I think they are just too hard.</li>
<li>From a nerd perspective, I wish I could map new and different gestures using the preference page. &nbsp;There's <a href="http://plentycom.jp/en/magicdriver/index.html">MagicDriver</a>, so I may give it a try. &nbsp;That said, I understand (and usually agree with) Apple's choices to keep things simple.</li>
</ul>
Overall, so far, I am very happy with the Magic Mouse as a simple 2 button mouse, with super-awesome scrolling. &nbsp;If I give MagicDriver a try, I'll report on whether additional gestures turn out to be useful or not.</div>
