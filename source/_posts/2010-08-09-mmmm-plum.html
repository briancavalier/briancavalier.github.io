<p>I've been a big fan of American Express for a while. &nbsp;So, when it came time to get a business credit card for my new company, I debated about whether to get a Plum Card or just go with the standard Amex Green, or Gold. &nbsp;Today I got to take advantage of one of the benefits of the Plum--pay early and get a cash refund. &nbsp;That's right, not airline miles, or points that expire, but cash. &nbsp;So far, I'm happy with my choice.</p>
