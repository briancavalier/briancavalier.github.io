<div>Last Friday, I gave an overview talk on user experience at <a href="http://www.alphalab.org/">AlphaLab</a>. &nbsp;I think it went well, and there was some good discussion afterward. &nbsp;<a href="http://briancavalier.com/presentations/ux1/UX.html">The slides</a>&nbsp;are a very quick read (one might even call them stark!), but I figured I'd make them available. &nbsp;I think they hit the major points that I try to consider when thinking about user experience at a high level, and I also tried to include some concrete things that can help when designing your users' experience.</div>
<p />
<div>Thanks to AlphaLab for hosting the yummy lunch, and to everyone who came and participated in the discussion!</div>

<div>UPDATE: A colleague asked for a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/259524/presentations/ux/UX-2.4.2010.pdf" title="UX Presentation">PDF of the presentation</a>, so I figured I'd make that available as well.</div>
