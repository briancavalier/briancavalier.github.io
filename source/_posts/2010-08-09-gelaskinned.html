<div>While I wait for my free bumper from Apple, I decided to give <a href="http://www.gelaskins.com/" title="Gelaskins">Gelaskins</a>&nbsp;a try. &nbsp;So, here's a quick pic of my iPhone, gelaskinned up with <a href="http://www.gelaskins.com/gallery/Kofie_One/Smoggy_Air">Smoggy Air</a>, which I think looks pretty spiffy. &nbsp;It was very easy to apply--just clean the surface with a microfiber cloth of some sort (the one I used came with a pair of sunglasses I bought last year), carefully line up the camera, volume, and vibrate cutouts, then stick it in place and smooth it out.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also does seem to solve the antenna death grip problem for me. &nbsp;I definitely noticed a drop in signal without it, usually from 3 bars to 1 at my house, and with the gelaskin applied, it stays at 3 bars no matter how I hold it. &nbsp;All in all, I'm very happy with it, and while $15 might be just a tad high, it's certainly more reasonable than the ridiculous prices of some of the "real" cases out there.</p>
