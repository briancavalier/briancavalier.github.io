<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, our 15 year old TV died, so we bought a new Samsung LCD. Shortly after we got it, our neighbor was visiting and asked if we had HD, which we didn&#8217;t. We&#8217;ve always had the cheapest TV service we could get. He told us about the deal he got on a Comcast Triple Play package, and it was about $50 less than we were spending each month on separate services. So, we decided to check it out.</p>
<p>We now have a Comcast Triple Play package, but only after a lot of frustration and wasted time. Comcast has let us down at nearly every step in the process of selling, installing, and configuring just about everything.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, we have dealt with some wonderful, pleasant, and helpful <em>individuals</em>&nbsp;at Comcast, but only after we&#8217;ve called to report each of the many problems. So, I&#8217;m really talking about Comcast <em>The Company</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Comcast&#8217;s website is pretty, but is all marketing speak, and light on really useful information. For example, it is impossible to find out what channels are a part of any Triple Play bundle. If you click&nbsp;<a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/259524/comcast-bundles.png">that &#8220;View Channel Lineup&#8221; link</a>&nbsp;it&#8217;ll take you to a listing of every channel Comcast offers, including all the ones you <em>won&#8217;t</em> actually get in your package.</li>
<li>The final &#8220;live chat&#8221; step is a disaster. We had to call and start our order from scratch after the chat applet failed several times.</li>
<li>They misconfigured our internet package as &#8220;Economy&#8221;, which is 768 <em>Kbps</em>, rather than the 15 <em>Mbps</em> that is <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/259524/comcast-bundles.png" title="15 Mbps HD Triple Play feature">clearly stated</a> in the HD&nbsp;Starter&nbsp;Triple Play bundle we purchased. It took many hours on the phone, twittering with reps, and then finally speaking with several manager-level folks to get this resolved.</li>
<li>Caller ID did not display on our TV as it is supposed to. Again, this took several hours on the phone, and several tries by reps to &#8220;fix&#8221; the problem. Apparently, our cable box had been misconfigured.</li>
<li>The cable box Comcast installed was an older (2005), fairly beat up (many scratches and a couple dents) box. About a month after installation, it began crashing (no video output, non-responsive to remote control <em>and</em> buttons on front panel). They did replace it with a newer box (which has HDMI out) for free, but I still had to go through the hassle of calling and working my schedule around the house call.</li>
<li>When we placed the order, we specifically asked several times what setup fees we would be charged. The rep assured as that we would only pay a setup fee for Digital Voice, since we already had Comcast TV and internet service. When we got our first bill, we were charged a $99 &#8220;Installation Fee&#8221; in addition to the $30 Digital Voice setup fee. We had to call once again and escalate it to a manager-level person to get the charge removed.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s 2009, why does the onscreen user interface of my cable box (the&nbsp;<em>new HDMI&nbsp;</em>cable box) look like Donkey Kong? &nbsp;Why doesn&#8217;t it look like <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/" title="Plex Media Center">this</a>?</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, it has been a very bad customer experience. I hope that Verizon&#8217;s move into Pittsburgh will encourage Comcast to stop resting on their monopoly and do better.</p>
